<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-live-notification/">BuddyPress Live Notification</a> plugin was originally released in 2011. Brajesh Singh, prolific plugin author and founder of <a href="http://buddydev.com/" target="_blank">BuddyDev</a>, created the plugin to provide Facebook-style real-time notifications for users. Over the past four years, a number of significant changes in both WordPress and BuddyPress have necessitated a complete rewrite of the extension.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://buddydev.com/buddypress/introducing-buddypress-live-notification-2-0/" target="_blank">2.0 version</a> of the plugin adds support for BuddyPress&#8217; new <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-1-9-sammy-released-with-new-notifications-component" target="_blank">notifications component</a>, as well as the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_heartbeat_settings" target="_blank">Heartbeat API</a>, which is now used to fetch the notifications.</p>
<p>The updated version includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete rewrite of the code to include support for BP notifications component (introduced in BuddyPress 1.9.0)</li>
<li>Uses WordPress Heartbeat API instead of long AJAX polling for greatly improved performance</li>
<li>Allows theme authors to change the notifying mechanism by overriding the  notify  method of the  bpln object</li>
<li>Fires custom JavaScript event bpln:new_notifications when new notifications are received on the client side. A theme author can hook into it to make modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because BP Live Notification was designed to be easy to theme and extend, Singh created an <a href="https://github.com/sbrajesh/bp-live-notification-example-module" target="_blank">example plugin</a> to demonstrate how to replace the notify window UI with your own customization.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jquery-notice-style.png" rel="prettyphoto[40500]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jquery-notice-style.png?resize=449%2C250" alt="jquery-notice-style" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40617" /></a></p>
<p>The sample plugin repackages the notification window with the <a href="https://github.com/sbrajesh/bp-live-notification-example-module/tree/master/assets/notify" target="_blank">jQuery notice plugin</a>. Check out a <a href="http://creativedream.net/plugins/jquery.notify/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see how that style of notice is presented.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like how BP Live Notification styles its alerts by default, you can easily integrate a different jQuery notice plugin using the example Singh posted on GitHub. Searching the web will turn up a <a href="http://jqueryhouse.com/best-jquery-notification-plugins/" target="_blank">wide variety</a> of beautiful notification styles that you can adapt for use with BuddyPress.</p>
<p>Both Twitter and Facebook use live notifications to keep users interacting on their social networks. When you receive a live notice, it confirms, in an almost tangible way, that you are at the center of where the social activity is happening. If you think this would benefit your BuddyPress network, download <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-live-notification/">BP Live Notification</a> 2.0 for free from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 02:07:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Many users were taken by surprise, given that the WordPress codex clearly stated that automatic plugin and theme updates are disabled by default.</p>
<p>Shortly after the automatic update rolled out, the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates" target="_blank">codex page</a> was updated to reflect the fact that in rare instances WordPress.org will automatically update your plugins and themes unless you opt to turn this feature off entirely. Many users are not comfortable with forced automatic updates, but the good news is that there is a filter to turn them off, including the WordPress.org security updates for popular plugins:</p>
<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', '__return_false' );</pre>
<p>Prior to this security issue, users were not aware that they had to opt out of these forced updates. On one side of the fence there are those who think it&#8217;s no big deal and are thankful that WordPress.org is proactive on behalf of user security.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are those who are wary of forced updates from plugin authors who are notorious for pushing out problematic updates. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo">support forum</a> for Yoast&#8217;s SEO plugin contains many threads regarding fatal errors following updates issued in the past.</p>
<p>In this particular case, Nick Haskins <a href="http://nickhaskins.com/2015/03/on-automatic-wordpress-updates/" target="_blank">summarizes</a> why he was not comfortable with WordPress.org&#8217;s forced update:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plugin in question is Yoast WordPress SEO. If you‚Äôre not familiar with his plugins, the history of updates is awful. In the last two weeks, I‚Äôve updated twice, and both times have resulted in fatal PHP errors which require FTP‚Äôing into the site, to manually remove the plugin. Both cases were due to not checking if a file exists before loading it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who are not comfortable with WordPress.org&#8217;s forced update policy have the option to turn updates off for particular plugins or for all plugins. If you opt to go the route of turning automatic updates off, there are alternative ways that you can stay up-to-date on plugin releases.</p>
<h3>Get Email Notices When Core, Plugin, and Theme Updates are Available</h3>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/air-mail.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40498]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/air-mail.jpg?resize=1018%2C494" alt="photo credit: Par avion - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-40600" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79016591@N07/13204207393">Par avion</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>
<p>No site admin can realistically be expected to log into his site(s) and check for update every day, let alone follow all the news surrounding plugin and theme security issues. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updates-notifier/" target="_blank">WP Updates Notifier</a> plugin will monitor your WordPress installation for updates and will send you an email as they become available. It includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the interval of how often to check for updates; hourly, twice daily or daily.</li>
<li>Sets WordPress to check for updates more often meaning you get to know about updates sooner.</li>
<li>Get emailed about core, plugin and theme updates.</li>
<li>Chose if you want to be notified about active only themes and plugins updates.</li>
<li>Remove upgrade nag message to non-admin users.</li>
<li>For advanced users there are a number of filters and actions you can use.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be truly awesome if WP Updates Notifier was also able to scan a plugin&#8217;s changelog for the word &#8220;Security&#8221; and tack it onto the email if it is applicable.</p>
<p>WP Updates Notifier can be useful even if you&#8217;re comfortable allowing WordPress.org to perform occasional forced updates to themes and plugins for security. You may be using a plugin that is not nearly popular enough meet the criteria for a forced automatic update. Regardless, it may be useful for you to know as soon as there is an update available.</p>
<p>The important thing is to stay in the loop about potential security issues and get patches as soon as they are available. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updates-notifier/" target="_blank">WP Updates Notifier</a> lets you do that without having to allow any third party update core, plugins, or themes on your server. The plugin is most useful when you have only a handful of sites or fewer. Otherwise, it&#8217;s probably better to utilize a central dashboard service where you check in regularly to see updates across all of your sites at once.</p>
<p>Your other alternative is to ditch plugins created by authors who you cannot trust to issue clean updates. That will put you in a better position to leave automatic background updates on, which is recommended for the vast majority of WordPress users.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 19:38:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

CGCookie has been around since 2008, and today is a network of five websites, has thousands of paying members, a team of six full time employees plus¬†a number of contractors.</p>
<p>CGCookie is built completely on WordPress and has a built in membership component. Some astute readers may recognize both the site and Jonathan&#8217;s name; Jonathan is <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">Pippin Williamson&#8217;s</a>¬†identical twin brother, and Pippin has worked with Jonathan on¬†CGCookie many times. So, in this interview, you&#8217;re not listening to me talk to Pippin &#8212; though it sounds like it &#8212; but I&#8217;m talking to Jonathan Williamson.</p>
<p>Jonathan is as passionate about CG, modeling, 3D printing, and the software that surrounds these disciplines as Pippin is about WordPress and programming. It was a pleasure to talk to Jonathan about what it&#8217;s like to run a membership site that runs on WordPress. I think this interview will be beneficial for those that want to run a membership site, and also those that work with clients who make their living off of their website.</p>

<h3>How CGCookie evolved</h3>
<p>CGCookie started as a blog with news, tutorials, and resources for CG enthusiasts. The first form of its monetization was by selling the source files for the various tutorials. Within about two years, Jonathan and co-founder Wes Burke decided to add a membership component¬†that ended up working far better than they anticipated.</p>
<p>Jonathan has been working full-time on CGCookie since around the summer of 2009. They originally launched on aMember, before eventually migrating to Pippin&#8217;s <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> plugin, along with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Today, CGCookie has more than 120,000 free users, and they have around 4,800 paid members.</p>
<p>Since 2008, CGCookie have¬†managed to not have a full time web developer until February of 2014, when they hired Nick Haskins. You may recognize Nick as the founder of <a title="Aesop, a Medium-esque ‚Äústory engine‚Äù for WordPress" href="https://poststatus.com/aesop-medium-esque-story-engine-wordpress/">Aesop Stories</a> as well. Nick manages front-end development for the site, and they still don&#8217;t have a backend developer &#8212; though a backend developer and designer are on their roadmap.</p>
<h3>How CGCookie&#8217;s eCommerce setup runs</h3>
<p>Considering Jonathan is¬†using¬†his brother&#8217;s own plugins in the real world, it makes for a great avenue for feedback and insight for Pippin to improve those products.</p>
<p>CGCookie is using Restrict Content Pro for <a href="https://cgcookie.com/membership/">memberships</a> themselves, and EDD plus the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/frontend-submissions/">Front-End Submissions</a> add-on for their <a href="http://cgcookiemarkets.com/blender/">marketplace</a>. We talked about whether EDD could be used for both, or if there is room for improvement in the marriage between the two systems, and he believes there is and that it&#8217;s a goal for the two plugins. For instance,¬†currently, reporting and user management and a number of other features are independent between each plugin even though often times the users that utilize the system may overlap.</p>
<p>I asked Jonathan about scaling WordPress and eCommerce for their large user base. He says that scaling for eCommerce has not been difficult, but with over a hundred thousand users, some default WordPress functionality has not scaled well; for instance, some admin areas create dropdowns for all users, which does not work well. Fortunately, there are some trac tickets in place currently to help solve some of these problems.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing goals for a membership site</h3>
<p>When discussing challenges running a membership site, Jonathan highlights the internal battles: balancing new features versus iterative improvements. Based on my short experience managing¬†this membership site, I completely agree.</p>
<p>For an example, Jonathan told me about a potential question and answer system to help his members get answers for specific technical topics that may be beyond the scope of a specific course. They believe a Stack Exchange style setup that allows them to refer their courses to specific questions would allow them to better serve their customers with the same content they already have.</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you get people to find your content that answers their question, but you don&#8217;t have¬†a way of just explicitly saying that these are the questions this course answers?</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re considering a method of post to post relationships that direct courses as question answers and vice versa. For this feature and others, they try to do things with a short return on investment, but they also don&#8217;t want to be a slave to it. They sometimes¬†do things &#8220;that are important to the quality of CGCookie, that never make a dime.&#8221; They removed ads last year under that very premise, to make CGCookie a better learning experience.</p>
<h3>Not the only place to learn</h3>
<p>Jonathan knows CGCookie isn&#8217;t the only place to learn, so they focus on creating an excellent community and learning experience for their customers.</p>
<p>Realizing that our sites aren&#8217;t the only way to get certain information is an important thing to know to be able to better focus what we create for our users and why we create it.</p>
<h3>Pricing for CGCookie</h3>
<p>CGCookie has pricing for monthly, quarterly, or yearly pricing; all plans renew automatically unless explicitly cancelled. This is a feature they actively A/B test to see what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Behavior of customers varies between the three levels. Jonathan says that the users are more invested in their purchases (and getting more out of it) when they sign up for longer.¬†Quarterly members have 10% longer lifetime memberships and spend three times longer on the site.</p>
<p>However, they do have &#8220;a fair bit&#8221; of what I called &#8220;download and dash&#8221; members that sign up for a month, download a bunch of assets and cancel. Monthly memberships are also the most popular plan. They&#8217;ve considered locking down downloads for monthly signups but it&#8217;s not something they want to do unless it becomes a bigger problem; however they do lose money on those customers that download gigabytes of files and videos but¬†only stay subscribed for one month.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>During A/B tests, they have found that people will be just as likely to sign up for quarterly as monthly if monthly isn&#8217;t available, and quarterly members are more engaged. One thing they noted is that once people stick around for a few months, the average tenure of a user skyrockets; they have some users that have been a paying member as long as the site has been running.</p>
<p>One of my big takeaways talking to Jonathan was about how significant testing can be. Their tests help them decide on the¬†optimal pricing and payment plans to maximize a lifetime value.</p>
<p>For testing, insights, and statistics they use¬†<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, and Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Mixpanel allows you to create custom events in your software, and does require some code knowledge, but it can deliver valuable insights if you use it correctly.¬†Jonathan notes, &#8220;It&#8217;s basically as comprehensive as you make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can also mesh tools. They can track which A/B test from Optimizely a customer signed up with, and then use Mixpanel to track what they did and how they did it. They can get login metrics, renewal numbers, and more for each plan and signup flow.</p>
<p>Mixpanel requires PHP and JavaScript knowledge to utilize, but Optimizely has an extensive visual interface that doesn&#8217;t require code knowledge to utilize.</p>
<h3>What encourages membership signups</h3>
<p>&#8220;It varies day to day, week to week, month to month,&#8221; in regard to how their signups work. A bad month in the economy can make their signups go down. Sometimes quarterly users will spike while monthly users are steady.</p>
<p>Their biggest thing that affects signup rates is customer support. Some presale, but also support for new members to help answer questions and get people engaged. <span class="pullquote alignright">When we can help someone answer the question, &#8220;Where do I go next?&#8221;, we are able to keep them for a long time.</span></p>
<p>They have one or two courses that drive a ton of traffic to their site, and it is therefore their largest onboarding channel for new members. However, they don&#8217;t have a silver bullet for what it takes to get new users. They are always trying new things.</p>
<h3>On competing and the industry</h3>
<p>Jonathan doesn&#8217;t see themselves as a part of a singular industry. While many think of CG as a part of the film industry, it&#8217;s one of dozens of potential applications, and they don&#8217;t want to narrow themselves to a particular one.</p>
<p>They also poll users to get a feel for who they are and what industry actual users come from. Based on around a thousand responses, they had no real pattern at all. The results were all over the board.</p>
<p>So they don&#8217;t want to compete with a film tutorials site or any other industry site. They want to focus on the tool itself. They want to teach people how to use Blender and show them how it can be applied to various industries their users are a part of.</p>
<h3>Advice for those running membership sites</h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Build your community would be the main one. It&#8217;s one thing to offer a really good product. It&#8217;s one thing to¬†build a really good website. But if you don&#8217;t have the¬†community behind you that&#8217;s going to be willing to trust in you with their wallet &#8230; it&#8217;s not going to go anywhere long term, sustainably.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonathan says it&#8217;s about building the community as well as the sense of trust within that community. He believes that customers will want to know that not only the content will be worth it, but that it will continue to be worth it &#8212; and that the communication and support from the team behind the site will be consistent as well.</p>
<p>He believes that subscriptions and products are very different. With a subscription, the interaction is just as or far more important than specific content itself.</p>
<p>When he refers to community, he doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be strictly through something like a forum. He considers it a broad term, and for them it evolved out of their Blender community user base. At the time we recorded this, they didn&#8217;t have forums, a dedicated chat system, or an actual community integration part &#8212; though <a href="http://community.cgcookie.com/">they have opened a forum</a> since we chatted. But the community exists and thrives within comments and their gallery functionality.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>Jonathan is full of great advice and I could listen to him talk about membership sites for a long time. I have no experience with CG but at the end of this interview he had me wanted to go build something with Blender.</p>
<p>You can (and should) keep up with <a href="https://twitter.com/carter2422">Jonathan on Twitter</a>, or perhaps you&#8217;ll see him at a conference near you &#8212; but you&#8217;ll probably think it&#8217;s Pippin at first. Also be sure to checkout <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie&#8217;s website</a>; it&#8217;s really great.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:01:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

It&#8217;s &#8220;pencils down&#8221; time for core contributors as far as new feature requests are concerned. This is the point in the release cycle where contributors are focusing their efforts on bug fixes and inline documentation.</p>
<p>Drew Jaynes, the 4.2 release lead, posted the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/03/wordpress-4-2-beta-1/" target="_blank">beta release announcement</a> and summarized the main features that could use further testing. The <a href="http://wptavern.com/preview-the-press-this-bookmarklet-redesign-alpha-plugin-now-ready-for-testing" target="_blank">Press This bookmarklet feature has been totally redeigned</a> to be more intuitive and mobile-friendly.

<p>Jaynes also encourages users to test drive the new theme browsing and switching capabilities that are now built into the customizer. &#8220;We‚Äôre especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The customizer theme switcher is one of the more controversial additions to this release. The new feature was met with a significant amount of resistance from our commenters when it was <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-theme-switcher-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-2" target="_blank">approved for merge into WordPress 4.2</a>.</p>

<p>The installation and update process for plugins has been beautifully re-tooled to provide a smoother, more convenient experience where users can perform these actions without leaving the Plugins screen. Feel free to leave any feedback on the corresponding <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29820" target="_blank">ticket</a> for this improvement.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 also <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-on-track-to-expand-core-support-for-emoji" target="_blank">expands core support for emoji</a>. Jaynes suggested that users go to town on testing it everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you felt like emoji were starkly missing from your content toolbox, worry no more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We‚Äôve added emoji support nearly everywhere, even post slugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the current <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-2-project-schedule/" target="_blank">4.2 project schedule</a>, the official release is targeted for the week of April 22nd. A series of betas and at least one release candidate are likely to precede the official release during the course of the next month.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 00:01:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>About two months ago, I released my first commercial WordPress product, <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, a plugin that makes deploying themes and plugins really easy. WP Pusher was not meant to be &#8220;just a plugin&#8221;. It was supposed to be a SaaS product, and throughout it all, when I was building it, I always thought of it as a startup I was creating.</p>
<p>For &#8220;just a WordPress plugin&#8221;, I think it has been quite successful so far, and to a large extent, I believe that to be a result of my own perception of the whole thing. I think it was more successful because, even after I realized it was just going to be a plugin, I still treated it as a startup.</p>
<h2>What Is a Startup?</h2>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/office.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[40528]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/office.jpeg?resize=1025%2C493" alt="office" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40552" /></a></p>
<p>In the fall of 2014, I was traveling around Southeast Asia, enjoying the digital nomad lifestyle, while making WP Pusher. I spent quite a bit of time in Chiang Mai, the capital of digital nomads, and everyone was talking about a guy named Pieter Levels, who did all kinds of cool things, all related to digital nomadism. One of these things was to take up the challenge of building a new startup every month for 12 months.</p>
<p>Hearing people talk about Pieter&#8217;s startup quest got me thinking about the term &#8220;startup&#8221;. Honestly, when I first heard about it, I did not think of the 12 startups as real startups &#8211; which Pieter obviously did. To me, creating a portfolio of 12 startups in such a short time seemed a bit silly. In my head, a real startup required more dedication and commitment than that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some of Pieter&#8217;s startups have been really successful and the whole process has been really inspiring to follow. I now understand that my idea of a startup was missing some pieces. All of the 12 projects that Pieter created qualified as startups. Some of them were more successful than others, but he validated 12 ideas in a short time and the result is really impressive. And one thing, which is very important, is that Pieter treated all of the 12 projects as startups instead of just another side project (which is how many developers talk about their projects). Calling something a side project is an easy way of protecting yourself against your fear of failure.</p>
<p>If you ask Steve Blank about his definition of a startup, he will tell you that <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/" target="_blank">&#8220;a startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model&#8221;</a>. If we break that up, ‚Äúan organization‚Äù can mean anything. It can be you alone or it can be a team. ‚ÄúRepeatable‚Äù and ‚Äúscalable‚Äù are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Building a WordPress plugin and calling it a day is not enough. That is not a startup. Honestly, to me, ‚Äúrepeatable‚Äú is the main factor. I am in it for the freedom &#8211; not the empire building. I want a business to be repeatable in the sense that I can teach someone else how to run it for me &#8211; hence, freedom. It does not have to be scalable in order to put food on my table or allow me to travel around the world &#8211; it just has to be profitable.</p>
<p>WordPress offers a giant market full of small niches and potential customers. There is no reason why something you are building for WordPress could not be as huge as any other software startup. The market share of the WordPress platform is <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/" target="_blank">large enough</a>.</p>
<p>In relation to the Steve Blank quote, what could you do to make your WordPress plugin a startup instead of a side project? First of all, you need to think about the &#8220;organization&#8221;. Most likely, you are the programmer or the engineer behind your product. But do you know how to design a shiny, high-converting landing page? Do you have any clue about how to approach marketing or customer relations? What about the legal and financial aspects? Maybe you do. If you do not, you need to either be willing to learn or team up with someone who does. At the very minimum, you need to at least consider it.</p>
<p>How can you build a business around a WordPress plugin that is more &#8220;repeatable&#8221; and &#8220;scalable&#8221;? Well, you could do most of the things that other startups do. Here are a few questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you charge more or offer more expensive options?</li>
<li>Could you turn your plugin into a SaaS or find something that you could charge for on a recurring basis?</li>
<li>Could you sell additional add-ons or extensions for your plugin?</li>
<li>Could you offer a service in addition to your plugin?</li>
<li>Given you solve some kind of pain for your customers, could you copy your idea to other niches or customer segments?</li>
<li>Could you come up with ways to attract more customers on a recurring basis? (SEO, content marketing, advertising etc.)</li>
<li>Could you have someone else help you find new customers? (copywriters, affiliate partners etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You get it.</p>
<h2>Solving Your Own Problems vs. Solving Other People&#8217;s Problems</h2>
<p>A very important point I want to make relates to the business idea of your WordPress plugin. In a market like WordPress, programmers tend to be tempted to find solutions to their own problems &#8211; not necessarily other people&#8217;s problems. Finding a solution for a problem you have yourself is a good place to start and great for motivation, domain knowledge and so on, but it is not enough.</p>
<p>If you want it to be a business, you need to make sure that other people have the same problem and are willing to pay for it. Startups are not made to solve their own problems. The original business idea behind the startup might have been to solve a problem the founder had, but if the only customer in the startup is going to be the founder alone, it is not a very good business model. You need to figure out how you can make your product relevant to more people &#8211; not everyone of course, but more people than yourself.</p>
<p>As an example, WP Pusher solves a problem I had with clients. There were already solutions to this problem &#8211; both free and paid. Most of them required either Git installed or that I granted them access to my clients&#8217; servers. Given I am actually in control of, or at least have an influence over, most of the server environments of my clients, I could in theory have used one of these existing solutions.</p>
<p>However, I knew that was not the case for a lot of WordPress developers. I saw the possibility of solving my own problem as well as solving a problem I knew a lot of other developers had. Reading about Pieter&#8217;s 12 startups inspires me to build more products for WordPress. Solve more problems. Build more startups.</p>
<h2>Say It Out Loud</h2>
<p>When I thought WP Pusher was going to be a SaaS business, I thought of it as a startup. When I decided to change the business model and rebuild it all as a single plugin, it felt weird calling it a business &#8211; or even a startup. For a short time I think I phrased it as &#8220;just a project for WordPress&#8221;, when telling people about it.</p>
<p>Personally, I still like to think of it as a startup. I kept the landing page I built for the SaaS and I kept the blog I set up. I kept everything that I initially made when it was a &#8220;startup&#8221; I was working on. Today, I have made a conscious decision that it is in fact a startup &#8211; no matter how big or small it is.</p>
<p>WP Pusher has many characteristics of a startup. It solves a very obvious pain point that is easy to communicate. It has a simple business model in a very large market. And finally, it has a logo and it has a nice landing page. That is a startup right there.</p>

<p>File download URLs are more secure, have better performance, and are more reliable. URLs now contain secure tokens and expiration dates to maintain the security of files. This decreases the likelihood of individuals being able to tamper with downloadable files. URLs are also shorter and easier to share.</p>
<p>EDD 2.3 significantly improves stat tracking. For example, when you add or remove Download products on an existing payment record, the earnings and sales for the affected products are now properly updated when the payment record is saved. Performance improvements to reports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax reports are now much more efficient</li>
<li>A race condition related to the update process for Download earnings / sales has been¬†resolved</li>
<li>Individual customer stats are now much more performant</li>
<li>The Sales / Earnings widget on the Dashboard now loads via Ajax to improve the first-load performance</li>
</ul>
<p>According <a title="https://twitter.com/chriscct7/status/575724923899023360" href="https://twitter.com/chriscct7/status/575724923899023360">to Chris Christoff</a>, core developer of EDD, the product has officially passed 10,000 commits made by 121 people¬†since its inception on Github. Pippin Williamson, founder of EDD, states on Twitter that even though the release adds substantial features, the code base has shrunk significantly.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Thanks to the keen eyes of <a href="https://twitter.com/andyfragen">@andyfragen</a>, it's been noticed that the EDD code base shrunk significantly with 2.3, even though we add a LOT</p>

<p></p>
<p>EDD 2.3 has eight other notable improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download products can now be added to the cart with multiple price IDs at one time</li>
<li>Better support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/" target="_blank">Polylang</a>¬†plugin has been added</li>
<li>PayPal Buy Now buttons no longer create pending payment records on each click</li>
<li>A new {ip_address} email tag has been added</li>
<li>Numerous new¬†action hooks and filters have been added for developers</li>
<li>Numerous translation files have been added and several new languages as well</li>
<li>The display of items in the cart widget has been improved to properly show quantities</li>
<li>A large number of minor PHP issues have been resolved</li>
</ul>

The foundation exists to further the mission of the open source project, most importantly by ensuring free access to the software for years to come. It also serves to protect the WordPress-related trademarks and educate the public about the software.</p>
<p>With that mission at its core, it&#8217;s fitting that the foundation selected Twenty Fifteen for the new look.

<p>When we offered a <a href="http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-designs-for-the-twenty-fifteen-default-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">first look at the design of Twenty Fifteen</a> prior to its release, readers made it clear that this theme would be more enthusiastically received than any other default theme in WordPress&#8217; recent history. Twenty Fifteen offers users a clean canvas that easily lends itself to customization.</p>
<p>Nick Hamze&#8217;s personal <a href="http://blog.nickhamze.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> is another beautiful example of a Twenty Fifteen customization in the wild.</p>

<p>WordCamps in particular are making excellent use of the default theme as a base for their event websites. <a href="http://maine.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Maine 2015</a> is a prime example of how designers are creatively adapting Twenty Fifteen:</p>

<p><a href="http://london.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp London 2015</a> organizers used the default theme to bring a grunge look to their site with the help of Google fonts and spray paint style backgrounds.</p>

<p>Armed with a unique background image and a little bit of color inspiration, it&#8217;s easy for anyone to make their own totally unique version of Twenty Fifteen. Thanks to the options built into the customizer, you may not even need to create a child theme.</p>

<p>Akismet 3.1 <a title="https://blog.akismet.com/2015/03/11/akismet-3-1-wordpress/" href="https://blog.akismet.com/2015/03/11/akismet-3-1-wordpress/">is available for download</a> and contains a bug fix that prevents it from inadvertently modifying a comment‚Äôs content during the spam filtering process. In addition to the bug fix, calls made to the Akismet API are now encrypted via SSL.</p>
<p>While it may not seem like much on the surface, encrypting communications between WordPress and Akismet is an important change that increases the privacy of those who leave comments on your site. Christopher Finke, who works on the Akismet development team, explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>Akismet&#8217;s API is being offered over SSL for the same reason that all <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> subdomains are <a title="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/reset-the-net/" href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/reset-the-net/">now served over SSL by default</a>. Encrypting that connection decreases the chances of surveillance by a third-party. No matter what a commenter is writing about, sending their comment to be checked using SSL ensures that it will only be read by those who are meant to read it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is part of a larger effort to apply SSL across WordPress.com and WordPress.org. In late 2014, almost all of WordPress.org <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/09/23/wordpress-org-is-now-forced-ssl/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/09/23/wordpress-org-is-now-forced-ssl/">was transitioned</a> to load over SSL/HTTPS.

<p>A blind SQL injection vulnerability was discovered today in the popular <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast</a>. WPScanVulnerability Database <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/7841" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> after responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to the plugin&#8217;s author:</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest version at the time of writing (1.7.3.3) has been found to be affected by two authenticated (admin, editor or author user) Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The authenticated Blind SQL Injection vulnerability can be found within the &#8216;admin/class-bulk-editor-list-table.php&#8217; file. The orderby and order GET parameters are not sufficiently sanitized before being used within a SQL query.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yoast was quick to respond with a patch and released version 1.7.4 with the following security fix:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fixed possible CSRF and blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in bulk editor. Added strict sanitation to order_by and order params. Added extra nonce checks on requests sending additional parameters. Minimal capability needed to access the bulk editor is now Editor. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/ethicalhack3r" target="_blank">Ryan Dewhurst</a> from WPScan for discovering and responsibly disclosing this issue.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Immediate Update Advised</h3>
<p>Users running the most recent version are advised to update immediately. If you&#8217;re using Jetpack on all your sites, you can quickly update them by visiting: <a href="https://wordpress.com/plugins/wordpress-seo" target="_blank">https://wordpress.com/plugins/wordpress-seo</a>. There you will see all the sites where you have the plugin installed and can update from your centralized dashboard.</p>
<p>Hosting companies are scrambling to add a fix to protect customers. The Pressable status blog sent out an <a href="http://status.pressable.com/2015/03/11/wordpress-seo-vulnerability/" target="_blank">advisory</a> on the vulnerability and is immediately updating installations where the plugin is active:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our systems have already begun updating this plugin across all impacted sites on our systems, and we expect this process to be completed shortly.</p></blockquote>
<p>SiteGround has added a <a href="https://www.siteground.com/blog/wordpress-seo-by-yoast-vulnerability/" target="_blank">temporary fix</a> to tide customers over in the meantime before they have the chance to update. The company added new security rules to its WAF (web application firewall), which will actively filter any possible incoming hacking attempts that try to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Our security team has just added a fix to protect customers from a vulnerability in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WP?src=hash">#WP</a> SEO plugin by Yoast <a href="https://t.co/nP9qrJaO0x">https://t.co/nP9qrJaO0x</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> is active on more than one million websites. While many hosts are being proactive about getting plugin updates to customers, most of the plugin&#8217;s users will not be able to rely on their host to take care of the update. Keeping your site safe from the vulnerability is as easy as logging in and updating to the latest version.</p>

<p>Finding and linking to previously published content on your site is a daily necessity for bloggers and content managers. Usually, you have to search the frontend of your site or search posts/pages in the admin to track down the content you&#8217;re trying to link.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mentionable/" target="_blank">Mentionable</a> is a handy tool, created by the folks at <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a>, that saves a lot of time on internal linking. The plugin adds @mentions to the visual editor with autocomplete for any content published on the site, including posts, pages, media, and custom post types.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mentionable.png" rel="prettyphoto[39424]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mentionable.png?resize=843%2C438" alt="mentionable" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40405" /></a></p>
<p>Mentionable includes a settings panel for specifying the post types for which the plugin will be active. You can also select the post types that the auto-completion will match against. Users can further customize the plugin by replacing the mentionable tag with a custom <em>mentionable.php</em> template.</p>
<p>The support for custom post types means that users can call out recipes, books, movies, products, or posts from any registered content type as links within pages or posts. This makes it easy to link to the backstory for new content, put together quick reference lists, cross promote products, etc. &#8211; all without ever having to leave the post editor.</p>
<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised. When mentioning a post you don&#8217;t even have to start with the first word of the post title. The autocomplete will pick up any word found in a title, in case your memory of the exact title is foggy.</p>
<p>If you decide later on that you don&#8217;t want to use the plugin anymore, it won&#8217;t affect any of the links you created previously. Your content remains intact even after the plugin is deactivated and uninstalled.</p>
<p>A healthy amount of internal linking is often recommended for boosting your site&#8217;s SEO. According to Moz, <a href="http://moz.com/learn/seo/internal-link" target="_blank">internal links</a> are critical for establishing site architecture and spreading link juice. If you&#8217;re not in the habit of linking to your own content, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mentionable/" target="_blank">Mentionable</a> plugin will help you do it with minimal effort.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 01:17:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<blockquote><p>When a WordPress site is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network">converted to a Multisite install</a>, a ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù of subsites is created. The existing site is converted to the first subsite in¬†the¬†network. The database classes the network itself as a site (wp_site), and each subsite as a blog (wp_blogs).</p>
<p>Certain tables are used only by a subsite, and a new set of tables are created every time a site is added to the network. Each set of tables is differentiated by the blog_id for the subsite used in the table prefix. e.g. `wp_2_posts`.</p></blockquote>

<p><a title="https://www.codeguard.com/" href="https://www.codeguard.com/">CodeGuard</a>, a service that specializes in automated backups to the cloud, has published the results of its 2015 WordPress survey. The survey took place between February 18th-20th and was answered by 503 WordPress users. Backing up is an important part of maintaining a website, so it&#8217;s a bit shocking to see such high percentages of people who either don&#8217;t backup on a regular basis or who don&#8217;t think backup plans are important.</p>
<p>Out of 503 respondents:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% have received &#8220;very little training&#8221; in the use of WordPress</li>
<li>22% haven&#8217;t been trained at all in WordPress backup and have &#8220;no idea&#8221; how to do it</li>
<li>21% have seen the &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; multiple times, and &#8220;it&#8217;s horrible!&#8221;</li>
<li>69% have had a plugin fail after an update, and 24% have had it happen &#8220;many times&#8221;</li>
<li>63% have deleted files that were not backed up</li>
<li>22% said that a backup plugin seems &#8220;unimportant&#8221; to them</li>
<li>24% said &#8220;This site is my livelihood, I&#8217;d pay almost anything for a complete restore,&#8221; while 19% said they&#8217;d be willing to spend several thousand dollars, at least</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised to see only 24% of respondents use a backup plugin at all considering there&#8217;s so many <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=backup" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=backup">free options available</a>. There appears to be a correlation between those who have little to no WordPress training and the lack of education on how to establish a backup plan. I realize 503 WordPress users is not a large sample size, but the numbers indicate more education is needed on backup software, services, and strategies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also alarming to see 69% of respondents have had a plugin fail after an update and 24% of those have had it happen several times. This is further proof that WordPress is <a title="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-wordpress-to-automatically-update-themes-plugins-and-core-by-default" href="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-wordpress-to-automatically-update-themes-plugins-and-core-by-default">not ready to automatically update plugins</a> by default.</p>
<p>An important data point missing from the survey is how many of the respondents rely on automatic backups provided by their webhost. Not every user needs a plugin to manage backups and for a number of managed WordPress hosting companies, automatic backups are part of the package. In fact, most managed WordPress hosting providers discourage and disallow backup plugins from being used. An <a title="http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/" href="http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/">example is WP Engine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, however, we discourage the use of backup plugins. They needlessly duplicate our built-in functionality, rely on a large amount of local storage and can store files in an insecure manner. Not only that, many of these plugins run their backup jobs at inopportune times. This can slow database connectivity with extra ‚Äî and sometimes very large ‚Äî MySQL queries and cause timeouts on larger sites.</p></blockquote>
<p>This infographic provided by CodeGuard visually shows the survey&#8217;s results. When browsing, I suggest replacing <em>WordPress users</em> with <em>respondents</em> as WordPress users sounds too broad. After reviewing the data, let me know if the results surprise you or if it corresponds to what you&#8217;re experiencing with clients.</p>

<p>Version 2.6.5 of the popular <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" target="_blank">Antispam Bee</a> plugin is out today with a new feature that allows administrators to trust commenters with a <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>. The idea for the function was suggested by Caspar H√ºbinger, a long-time user of the plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a spam comment with a Gravatar image?  I haven‚Äôt,&#8221; H√ºbinger said in a <a href="http://glueckpress.com/6500/trust-the-gravatar/" target="_blank">post</a> introducing the new feature. &#8220;So I suggested to include an option in Antispam Bee to trust commenters with a Gravatar by default, and Sergej, creator of Antispam Bee, was kind enough to implement it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the plugin was mentioned by Matt Mullenweg during his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe 2014, English speakers have largely overlooked it in the past. Antispam Bee was created by German WordPress plugin developer <a href="http://wpcoder.de/" target="_blank">Sergej M√ºller</a> and its description page on WordPress.org is written in German. He has actively developed and maintained the plugin since 2009. It is currently used on 200,000+ installations of WordPress.</p>
<p>One might think that it would make sense to include an English copy of the description to gain a larger user base, but M√ºller elected to keep it in German due to the plugin&#8217;s incompatibilities. Antispam Bee is incompatible with many of the major commenting systems used by English speakers, including Disqus, Jetpack Comments, and AJAX Comment Form.</p>
<p>English speakers who use <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/comments/" target="_blank">Jetpack Comments</a> often use <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a>, since the two work together seamlessly. Akismet is far more well-known, since it comes packaged with WordPress by default. However, Antispam Bee has a solid set of features that make it a decent alternative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad-free</li>
<li>No storage of personal data</li>
<li>No registration required</li>
<li>Free for commercial projects</li>
<li>No adjustment required by theme templates</li>
<li>All functions can be controlled by the user</li>
<li>Statistics for the last 30 days displayed as a dashboard widget</li>
<li>Supports six languages: German, English, French, Russian, Dutch, and Slovenian</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin also comes with 20 configurable options for customizing its spam-blocking features, including the ability to disable spam email notifications, block comments from certain countries, allow comments only in certain languages, delete after X days, and much more. These options allow you to tailor your anti-spam shield to lessen your moderation load.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/antispam-bee.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40344]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/antispam-bee.jpg?resize=1025%2C714" alt="antispam-bee" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40377" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re intrigued by <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" target="_blank">Antispam Bee</a>&#8216;s latest feature that allows you to trust commenters who have a Gravatar, give the plugin a try the next time you&#8217;re reviewing spam-blocking solutions. The option is a creative use of WordPress&#8217; built-in support for Gravatar. Current users of the plugin can find the new setting in the admin under <strong>Settings > Antispam Bee</strong>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 19:06:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Developers are anxious for WordPress to bump up the minimum PHP requirement for core, as it&#8217;s currently lingering at 5.2, which is no longer among the <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php" target="_blank">supported versions of PHP</a>. As of August 2014, PHP 5.3 no longer receives patches for security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-version-stats-updated-more-than-13-of-sites-are-running-wordpress-4-1" target="_blank">Recent updates to WordPress.org stats</a> indicate that 16.4% of WordPress sites are still running on PHP 5.2 and 38% on PHP 5.3. According to lead developer Andrew Nacin, bumping the minimum required version is not likely to happen soon, due to the sheer number of sites that would be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>&#8220;One-sixth of all sites running PHP 5.2 is still many millions of sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we move the PHP minimum version too early, we risk stranding millions of installs on older versions of WordPress.&#8221; In the meantime, the WordPress project is researching the current state of PHP offerings available at popular hosts and will soon be urging them to update to more recent versions.</p>
<p>WordPress developer <a href="http://coenjacobs.me/" target="_blank">Coen Jacobs</a> believes that the effort to contact hosts will not be enough to help everyone. His new <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/" target="_blank">WPupdatePHP</a> project was created to educate end users on outdated versions of PHP. The <a href="https://github.com/WPupdatePHP/wp-update-php" target="_blank">WPupdatePHP library</a> is a tool that developers can bundle into their plugins in order to require users to upgrade to PHP 5.4+ hosting. It is intended for use within new plugins, not for locking users out of existing ones.</p>
<p>If a user does not meet the minimum PHP version requirements when installing the plugin, he will be presented with an admin notice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this plugin can not run on PHP versions older than [ specified version ]. Read more information about <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/">how you can update</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of the WPupdatePHP project is to enlist end users in putting pressure on hosts to <a href="http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/" target="_blank">update their versions of PHP</a>. A future version of the library would add the ability for developers to make the PHP version a ‚Äúsoft requirement,‚Äù which would still display the notice but won‚Äôt stop the user from using the plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core WordPress team can‚Äôt get every single hosting company to comply,&#8221; Jacobs said in a recent post titled <em><a href="http://coenjacobs.me/updating-php-everyones-responsibility/" target="_blank">Updating PHP is Everyone‚Äôs Responsibility</a></em>. &#8220;I admire their intentions, but in reality this is not going to help everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>He predicts a need for the WPupdatePHP library even after WordPress bumps its minimum required PHP version. &#8220;PHP 5.4 is actually already nearing its EOL date and we‚Äôre still figuring out how to make PHP 5.2 and 5.3 platforms go away,&#8221; he said. In mid-September 2015, PHP 5.4 will not longer receive security fixes.</p>
<p>Jacobs believes that the changes that need to happen require more than a one-time campaign where the WordPress project successfully badgers hosts to update to PHP 5.4.</p>
<p>&#8220;In six months we‚Äôll have this same issue all over again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as webhosting companies have finally finished off their PHP 5.2 and 5.3 environments, we can start this whole campaign all over again to get rid of PHP 5.4. And so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The end user is one of our most important, but underestimated, assets in this battle,&#8221; Jacobs said. &#8220;They have the strongest voice in this all.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Mar 2015 22:24:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The Lovecraft design was inspired by the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft" target="_blank">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, an American horror fiction author known for his &#8220;weird realism&#8221; &#8211; the idea that reality is fundamentally weird and the human mind is incapable of realistically representing it.</p>
<p>Nor√©n&#8217;s tribute to Lovecraft&#8217;s work is conveyed most clearly through the serif-heavy typography of the theme and a strong focus on the imagery assigned to each post. He selected Google Font&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display" target="_blank">Playfair Display</a> for page and post headers, accompanied by Georgia for the body text. The bright red links and red post meta complement the design&#8217;s literary theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png" rel="prettyphoto[40251]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="lovecraft" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40267" /></a></p>
<p>The homepage showcases a full-width header image and each post replaces that image with its own featured image. These images, along with the rest of the theme, gracefully scale down for smaller devices.</p>
<p>Lovecraft, like many other recently released themes, adds additional features by offering support for <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a>, including the infinite scroll module and styles for tiled galleries.</p>
<p>Nor√©n took every small detail into consideration when creating Lovecraft, as you can see with the blockquotes design, ordered lists, post media, and form styles on the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/style-guide/" target="_blank">Style Guide</a> page.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40251]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg?resize=617%2C217" alt="lovecraft-blockquote" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40283" /></a></p>
<p>The theme allows you to select the accent color via the customizer. It also includes support for a custom logo, editor styles, and matching widgets for Flicker, recent posts, and recent comments with thumbnails. Pages have an additional template for full-width display. Check out the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see Lovecraft in action.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a bold new theme for your blog and you appreciate strong serif fonts, Lovecraft is a thoughtfully-designed option.

<p>In August of 2013, <a title="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/13/wordpress-straight-pride-uk" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/13/wordpress-straight-pride-uk">Automattic was criticized</a> for its role in taking down <a title="https://oliverhotham.wordpress.com/2013/08/11/the-sordid-tale-of-how-i-was-censored-by-straight-pride-uk/" href="https://oliverhotham.wordpress.com/2013/08/11/the-sordid-tale-of-how-i-was-censored-by-straight-pride-uk/">Oliver Hotham&#8217;s website</a> after the Straight Pride UK group filed a DMCA takedown notice with WordPress.com. In the Guardian article, WordPress.com admitted that the takedown notice was an abuse of the law. In November of 2013, <a title="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/striking-back-against-censorship/" href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/striking-back-against-censorship/">Automattic announced</a> that it teamed up with Hotham in <a title="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/2013-11-21-final-hotham-complaint.pdf" href="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/2013-11-21-final-hotham-complaint.pdf">two</a> separate <a title="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/2013-11-21-final-retraction-watch-complaint.pdf" href="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/2013-11-21-final-retraction-watch-complaint.pdf">lawsuits</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed in federal court under Section 512(f) of the DMCA. Section 512(f) is the provision that allows users to hold people accountable when they make false infringement accusations.</p>
<p>Torrentfreak reports that <a title="http://torrentfreak.com/wordpress-wins-25000-from-dmca-takedown-abuser-150305/" href="http://torrentfreak.com/wordpress-wins-25000-from-dmca-takedown-abuser-150305/">Automattic has won the case</a> with a $25K settlement. According to court documents,¬†United States Magistrate Judge¬†Joseph Spero <a title="http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf" href="http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf">wrote a report</a> and recommendation in favor of Automattic and Hotham. The <a title="http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf" href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf">courts agreed with his report</a> and recommendation. Since the defendant chose to default, the courts saw no reason to require further expenditure of resources and awarded the victory to Automattic.</p>
<p>The settlement is split between three parties: Automattic&#8217;s employee time, attorneys, and Hotham.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is Ordered and Adjudged that defendant Nick Steiner pay damages in the amount of $960.00 for Hotham‚Äôs work and time, $1,860.00 for time spent by Automattic‚Äôs employees, and $22,264.00 for Automattic‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs fees, for a total award of $25,084.00.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two things I take away from the victory. First, it sets a precedent that Automattic can and will fight against those who abuse the <a title="http://automattic.com/dmca-notice/" href="http://automattic.com/dmca-notice/">DMCA takedown procedure</a>. Second, attorneys are expensive.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 07 Mar 2015 04:44:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>In November 2014, Onename <a href="http://blog.onename.io/decentralized-auth-identity-open-source/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be extending its Openname protocol to support decentralized authentication. The company also <a href="https://github.com/openname" target="_blank">open sourced the protocol and directory software</a> so that developers can build their own infrastructure with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the future of identity will be decentralized, and for any identity system to be truly decentralized, no entity can have a monopoly over registering users or displaying their profiles. Anyone should be able to claim a username and fill out their profiles either using a provider/registrar of their choice or on their own without any third party.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://openname.org/" target="_blank">Openname</a> decentralized identity and naming system is built on the Blockchain. It makes it possible for anyone to create an online identity, which can then be used to make Bitcoin transactions. The company&#8217;s long-term goal is to pioneer a decentralized authentication protocol:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we need is a password-less authentication process that doesn&#8217;t require any particular third party; an open, decentralized auth protocol that lets users conveniently sign in and be in control of the data they release to apps and where they store it.</p>
<p>Openname Auth is our work-in-progress proposal for decentralized, password-less authentication in which users login by simply entering a username (their openname) and approving an auth request on their desktop or mobile device.</p></blockquote>
<p>OneName <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/14/y-combinator-backed-onename-raises-1-5m-open-sources-its-bitcoin-identity-directory/" target="_blank">raised $1.5 million in funding</a> to continue developing the platform as part of its quest to <a href="http://blog.onename.io/evolution-of-the-internet/" target="_blank">return the web to its decentralized roots</a>.</p>
<h3>Openname Avatars for WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress core supports <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> by default for providing blog and comment author avatars. Thanks to the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/openname/" target="_blank">Opennname plugin for WordPress</a>, site administrators can now offer users the option to associate a Openname avatars with an account on self-hosted sites.</p>
<p>In order to test the plugin, you&#8217;ll need to first sign up for an <a href="https://openname.org/" target="_blank">Openname</a> account (which requires an account at Onename or Namecoin).</p>

<p>After you install the Openname plugin on your WordPress site, any registered user will be able to elect to use his Openname avatar by visiting /wp-admin/profile.php. Once you add your Openname, the plugin will keep your WordPress avatar in sync (with a short delay) with your Openname Avatar.</p>

<p>The Openname plugin was created by <a href="https://www.larrysalibra.com/" target="_blank">Larry Salibra</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.pay4bugs.com/" target="_blank">Pay4Bugs</a>. I tested it and found it to work as advertised.</p>
<p>In the future, once the Openname Auth is more developed, it would be awesome if Salibra added this to his WordPress plugin. Onename might do well to create its own official plugin for this. Given that WordPress currently powers 23% of the world&#8217;s websites, an official Openname authentication plugin might bring wider adoption for its decentralized identity system.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 23:30:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>As WordPress currently powers 23% of the web, the platform&#8217;s security is constantly under scrutiny. WordPress has long been a favorite target of hackers and spammers who want to get the most return on their efforts. Since the the platform powers millions of websites, a critical vulnerability with a popular plugin or WordPress core can affect a large chunk of the web in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>WordPress published a <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/security/" target="_blank">security white paper</a> this week to help the public learn more about the core software security. Many consultants have had the experience of clients who are considering WordPress but are wondering if it&#8217;s secure. This document was created both for decision makers who are evaluating WordPress and developers who are building on top of the software.</p>
<p>The document is available as a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/Security-White-Paper/blob/master/WordPressSecurityWhitePaper.pdf?raw=true" target="_blank">PDF</a>, and here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll find inside:</p>
<blockquote><p>This document is an analysis and explanation of the WordPress core software development and its related security processes, as well as an examination of the inherent security built directly into the software.</p></blockquote>
<p>The white paper gives an introduction to the core leadership team, the WordPress Security Team, how a release cycle works, and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. The second half of the document covers common security vulnerabilities and how WordPress protects itself against those potential risks.</p>
<p>Just like WordPress itself, the security white paper is open to contribution. Anyone can submit a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/Security-White-Paper" target="_blank">WordPress repository</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-security-whitepaper.png" rel="prettyphoto[40096]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-security-whitepaper.png?resize=1025%2C753" alt="wordpress-security-whitepaper" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40178" /></a></p>
<p>The security white paper is in need of translations in order to be more accessible to WordPress&#8217; global audience. If you can assist with a particular translation, the repository has simple instructions for how to submit it on GitHub.</p>
<blockquote><p>To translate the white paper, please create a sub-directory of the project, giving it the correct ISO639 code (for example, pt for Portuguese), and submit a pull request.</p></blockquote>
<p>WordPress consultants will find this white paper to be an excellent resource to refer to during sales negotiations. If you&#8217;re a developer just getting started learning about WordPress&#8217; inherent security, the document is provides a solid overview.</p>
<p>Hackers who are looking to receive bounty for finding security vulnerabilities can find <a href="https://hackerone.com/automattic" target="_blank">Automattic on HackerOne</a>. The company regularly rewards hackers with bounty for security bugs discovered with WordPress.com, which is powered by the core WordPress software.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 20:11:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>During the <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/">2013 State of the Word</a> presentation at WordCamp San Francisco, Matt Mullenweg announced a new project called <a title="https://github.com/WordPress/book" href="https://github.com/WordPress/book">WordPress The Book</a>. After nearly two years of writing, Siobhan McKeown <a title="https://twitter.com/SiobhanPMcKeown/status/573544639170478081" href="https://twitter.com/SiobhanPMcKeown/status/573544639170478081">has announced</a> that version one is ready for review. She also states that the book will be produced in just over a month and that now&#8217;s the time to give feedback.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Finished V1 of the WordPress book: <a href="https://t.co/MC59LjeyFH">https://t.co/MC59LjeyFH</a> We'll be producing it in just over a month so if you have feedback now's the time</p>
<p>&mdash; Siobhan McKeown (@SiobhanPMcKeown) <a href="https://twitter.com/SiobhanPMcKeown/status/573544639170478081">March 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>While you can download the book, I recommend browsing and reading it on Github so you don&#8217;t have to worry about opening files with the .MD extension. It&#8217;s also easier to submit pull requests to correct typos or grammatical errors. The book is <a title="https://github.com/WordPress/book/tree/master/Content" href="https://github.com/WordPress/book/tree/master/Content">divided into six parts</a> that contain a few chapters each.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPressBookChapters.png" rel="prettyphoto[40148]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40152" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPressBookChapters.png?resize=1025%2C432" alt="Chapters Of The WordPress History Book" /></a>Chapters Of The WordPress History Book
<p>If you come across any errors while reading the book, you can submit corrections by creating a pull request or an issue on the tracker. Here are a few things to look out for as you read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factual errors: notes about factual errors are welcome. All suggestions for changes should be evidenced with links that back up any claims. Any facts that cannot be corroborated will not be included.</li>
<li>Clarity: any paragraphs or sections that you feel are not clear. This would be of particular help in sections that are technical in nature.</li>
<li>Omissions: anything that you feel has been omitted or not sufficiently covered. Note that this is a lengthy piece of writing and many issues have to be condensed to ensure that it is a manageable and interesting read. Suggestions about omissions should be accompanied with information about why it should be included, and backed up with evidence as to their importance.</li>
<li>Images: if you have any images that you feel would complement the text, we&#8217;d love to have them.</li>
</ul>
<p>McKeown is also looking for help writing haikus. Ideally, she&#8217;d like one for the book&#8217;s opening and one for each section. It will be published in two forms, a digital edition for the web and an e-book. McKeown also hinted at the possibility of printing physical copies, &#8220;We&#8217;re investigating different print options, so the feasibility of doing a print run or of offering print on demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read a few chapters of the book already and it&#8217;s like a trip down memory lane. It&#8217;s interesting to read some of the historical moments of the project&#8217;s history, especially the years of GPL debates. Whether you&#8217;re brand new to WordPress and want to learn its history or you&#8217;re a veteran who needs a refresher, this book delivers. Please help McKeown by proofreading the first version and help make it the best WordPress history book possible.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 17:00:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>One of the greatest things about WordPress is its diverse community throughout the world. <a title="https://kinsta.com/" href="https://kinsta.com/">Kinsta</a> has published a <a title="https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/" href="https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/">fantastic and inspirational post</a> that looks at up and coming WordPress communities in 5 continents and 17 countries.</p>
<p>My favorite story is Juanfra Aldasoro, co-organizer of WordCamp Buenos Aires, describing how the WordPress community in Argentina was organized. In 2007, Buenos Aires hosted the first WordCamp outside the US. Despite hosting a few more WordCamps, the community lacked organization. Aldasoro explains how celebrating WordPress&#8217; 10th anniversary brought the right group of people together:</p>
<blockquote><p>When WordPress turned 10, in May of 2013, thanks to a banner in the Codex site we created a celebration meetup. More than 20 people showed up, and the good thing was that we were a bunch of geeks on the same track. We had the people but we were lacking an organization. The ones interested in having an organized community kept in touch, we formed WordPress Argentina (<a href="https://twitter.com/wpargentina" target="_blank">@wpargentina</a>) and during 2014 we started to hold more formal monthly meetups.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the things I noticed is that several of the people <a title="https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/" href="https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/">featured in the article</a> use Facebook groups for communication. Although¬†a number of US based WordPress meetups use <a title="http://www.meetup.com/" href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a>,¬†in other countries, Facebook appears to be the dominant way to communicate and organize members.</p>
<p>Meetups are grassroots efforts that help WordPress reach every corner of the globe. As Matt Mullenweg said during his 2014 <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/26/matt-mullenweg-the-state-of-the-word-2014/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/26/matt-mullenweg-the-state-of-the-word-2014/">State of The Word presentation</a>, &#8220;Organizing a meetup is one of the hardest things to do in terms of contributing to WordPress. Every single month, you have to come up with new stuff.&#8221; Those who help maintain community as a pillar of WordPress&#8217; success are helping to maintain its growth and popularity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to think about the enormous amount of WordPress education, contributions, and learning that takes place across the world everyday, thanks in large part to people like those featured in the article. It&#8217;s wonderful to see so many WordPress communities around the world growing in size to the point of¬† having their own WordCamps.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble organizing a WordPress meetup in your area, let us know in the comments. Thousands of people across the world access the Tavern on a daily basis and we might be able to help connect you to others in your area.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 05:16:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<blockquote><p>I feel like all the words are in you, you‚Äôre just blocking yourself, you‚Äôre blocking your creativity. Society has put up so many boundaries, so many limitations on what‚Äôs right and wrong that it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a pure thought out. It‚Äôs like a little kid, a little boy, looking at colors, and no one told him what colors are good, before somebody tells you you shouldn‚Äôt like pink because that‚Äôs for girls, or you‚Äôd instantly become a gay two-year-old. Why would anyone pick blue over pink? Pink is obviously a better color. Everyone‚Äôs born confident, and everything‚Äôs taken away from you. So many people try to put their personality on someone else.</p></blockquote>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 04:19:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

So, <a title="http://marcuscouch.com/" href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I invited him on the show to give us an update on how things are progressing. On average, WordPress Weekly is an hour-long. This episode however, is two hours and nine minutes, but is filled with deep conversations surrounding each project.</p>
<p>In this episode, we learn the history of BuddyPress and how its connection to WordPress MU (WordPress Multisite), influenced the project&#8217;s direction. Jacoby explains what GlotPress is and why its a cornerstone of the WordPress project. We discuss the future of comments on the web and the role bbPress can play in turning things around. Last but not least, we discuss whether Jacoby&#8217;s successful crowdfunding campaign has opened the door for others who need funding to work on open source projects.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t caught on to the <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> craze, it might be time to see what it&#8217;s all about. Fans of the open source container technology appreciate that it&#8217;s lightweight, super fast to boot up, and easy to share containers through the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>Docker standardizes an app platform and its dependencies so you can hand the box over to another party without worrying about conflicting dependencies or differences between machines. While virtual machines can be rather weighty with an application plus an entire guest operating system, Docker is much lighter, containing just the application and its dependencies.</p>
<h3>Introducing Wocker</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/vagrant-1-6.html" target="_blank">Vagrant 1.6.0</a>, released last May, introduced support for Docker-based development environments, enabling Vagrant to manage them within Docker-powered Linux containers, instead of virtual machines.</p>
<p>WordPress developers who want to incorporate Docker into their workflow now have a new tool at their disposal. <a href="http://wckr.github.io/" target="_blank">Wocker</a> is a Docker-based rapid development environment of WordPress.</p>
<p>If you already have Vagrant, VirtualBox, and the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin installed, then getting started with Wocker takes next to no time. Simply clone the Wocker repository:</p>
<p><code>$ git clone https://github.com/wckr/wocker.git &#038;&#038; cd wocker</code></p>
<p>Then run <code>vagrant up</code>.  You can now navigate to your Wocker development site at: <a href="http://wocker.dev/" target="blank">http://wocker.dev/</a>. Here you&#8217;ll find the latest version of WordPress installed with the default theme active.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wocker.png" rel="prettyphoto[40090]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wocker.png?resize=1025%2C650" alt="wocker" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40093" /></a></p>
<p>Running a new Wocker container takes just three seconds:</p>
<p><code>core@wocker ~ $ wocker run --name wp</code></p>
<p>The tasks of creating a new container, restarting a stopped container, or shutting down, can all be done in a matter of seconds with <a href="http://wckr.github.io/" target="_blank">Wocker commands</a>.</p>
<h3>Kite Koga on Creating Wocker</h3>
<p>Japanese WordPress developer <a href="https://twitter.com/ixkaito" target="_blank">Kite Koga</a> created Wocker to speed up his own development. Koga is also the organizer of the upcoming <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WordCampKansai2015" target="_blank">WordCamp Kansai 2015</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to use MAMP and VCCW for developing on WordPress,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;MAMP is simple and easy but I have to download or copy WordPress core and create a database every time. <a href="http://vccw.cc/" target="_blank">VCCW</a> is a great tool, and I still use it now and then. It has a lot of options and functions but takes awhile to provision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Koga also experimented with using <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a> before creating Wocker. &#8220;Maybe VVV is good for developing WordPress core, but I feel it&#8217;s not fit for developing on WordPress. It takes too long to provision every time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I found that Docker was a good choice for me,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;Once I have a Docker image, it takes only three seconds for every new WordPress container. However, Docker is a little tricky, and the command line is complex. Therefore, I made the Wocker command line to run containers and sync files with local more easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wocker is intentionally simple and limited to just a handful of options, as Koga&#8217;s primary objective was to make it super fast to create a new WordPress development environment. One drawback is that you cannot run two or more containers at the same time, but it takes just seconds to switch between containers.</p>
<p>Koga summarized the main reasons that he opted to use Vagrant to manage Docker deployments:</p>
<ol>
<li>I could write some provision scripts in the Vagrantfile, so users only have to do `$ vagrant up`</li>
<li>It was easier to map hostnames to IP addresses.</li>
<li>Vagrant with CoreOS was simpler to manage Docker images and containers than boot2docker.</li>
<li>To sync files between local machine, virtual machine, and the Docker container was tricky, so I made Wocker commands to make it easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to test out Wocker and find that it&#8217;s not for you, it&#8217;s easy and fast to uninstall. Simply run <code>$ vagrant destroy</code> to remove the Wocker folder, and your local machine will always be clean.</p>
<p>I tested Wocker and found that it was insanely fast to create new containers (as well as restart existing ones), a task for which I would require an extra utility (such as <a href="http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a>) to perform with VVV. If you find VVV to be too slow and want to check out an alternative, <a href="http://wckr.github.io/" target="_blank">Wocker</a> provides a faster way to set up simple development environments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 00:52:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Organizing an event the size of <a href="http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe</a> is a year-round endeavor. The 2015 event is just four months away, speaker applications are closed, and the organization team is already asking for applications for the next host city. So far, the camp has been held in Leiden and Sofia, and will come to Seville in June.</p>
<p>Applying to host WordCamp Europe is similar to applying to be an Olympic city. Local WordPress communities in potential host cities must submit applications, including a budget and a convincing plan. Organizers scrutinize the applications for the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation of the budget and venue research</li>
<li>Strength of the local WordPress community</li>
<li>The merits of the new location, as compared to the previous year</li>
<li>Affordability for attendees</li>
<li>Potential travel difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>This year <a href="http://wptavern.com/seville-spain-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2015" target="_blank">Seville, Spain was selected as the host city</a> after a short bidding process. WordCamp Central requested the event be scheduled earlier in the year to avoid calendar conflicts. This was an unusual turn of events but organizers are committed to re-instituting a public bidding process for all future events.</p>
<h3>WordCamp Europe to Pilot New Organizer Mentorship Program</h3>
<p>For months in advance, an all-star lineup of WordCamp organizers from around Europe put their heads together, sharing their experiences to plan the best event possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organizing WordCamp Europe is both a pleasure and a challenge,&#8221; co-organizer Petya Raykovska told the Tavern. &#8220;What‚Äôs great about it is that you get to work with experienced WordCamp organizers from across Europe. Each organizer brings their own knowledge and perspective to the organizing team which makes it a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event has traditionally highlighted the diversity of the European WordPress community and its <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014" target="_blank">attendees&#8217; eagerness to connect beyond boundaries</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs a challenge because each of us has our own way of doing things and we have to learn how to listen to each other and compromise,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;And, of course, there are all of those idioms that don‚Äôt cross language and cultural barriers!&#8221;</p>
<p>New WordCamp Europe organizers should be equipped with a solid grasp of diplomacy and the ability to work with others across cultural differences.</p>
<p>This year the current organization team plans to experiment with a mentorship program that would prepare the next crop of organizers to take the helm in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re introducing a new process that we hope will help not only find the best team for next year, but will also be a pilot for a mentorship program for future WordCamp Europe (or any large 600+ people WordPress event) events,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what we want to do in 2015 is choose the team for 2016 and get them to work with us for the 2015 edition, so they can get to know what it takes, get introduced to the processes, work closely with the existing team and monitor what&#8217;s required of the local team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current organizers are prioritizing mentoring new additions in order to create a seamless transition from one organizational team to the next. Instead of learning the ropes at the last minute, new organizers will have the opportunity to see how it works without all of the pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it will be highly beneficial for them and will ensure smooth sailing for next year&#8217;s organisation,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 19:32:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

An employee who goes by the name <a title="http://www.reddit.com/user/genesisfan" href="http://www.reddit.com/user/genesisfan">Genesisfan</a> on Reddit, <a title="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/">published a post </a>explaining how the company recently had its first theme accepted on ThemeForest and was willing to answer questions others had about the experience. According to the post, he spent the better part of six months with a designer he hired while working a full-time job developing <a title="http://themeforest.net/item/broadsword-a-wordpress-theme-to-share-stories/full_screen_preview/10514496" href="http://themeforest.net/item/broadsword-a-wordpress-theme-to-share-stories/full_screen_preview/10514496">Broadsword</a>.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BroadSword.png" rel="prettyphoto[40045]"><img class="size-full wp-image-40046" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BroadSword.png?resize=1025%2C496" alt="BroadSword Single Page View" /></a>BroadSword Single Page View
<p>When asked what he thought of the ThemeForest submission and review process, he responded, &#8220;We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly they turned around our review, and the level of detail they provided in their soft rejection. Aside from some technicalities that we&#8217;d missed (being more specific about what features we supported), the biggest issue was that we were missing some data validation in our files. Make sure you use the esc_ and sanitize_ functions provided by WordPress!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the issues were addressed, ThemeForest approved the submission and the team made its first sale within minutes of it going live. When asked what makes their theme different in the marketplace, he responded, &#8220;We kept the theme options to a minimum. We were both pretty tired of themes that include a thousand options and tend to be more like frameworks than standalone themes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on <a title="http://wptavern.com/envato-continues-to-rake-in-the-cash-from-wordpress-themes-packaged-as-complete-website-solutions" href="http://wptavern.com/envato-continues-to-rake-in-the-cash-from-wordpress-themes-packaged-as-complete-website-solutions">stats that highlight</a> how well ThemeForest is doing, it&#8217;s not surprising that Warriors of code made their first sale within minutes of going live. However, the company used social media to its advantage, so it&#8217;s possible one their followers purchased the theme based on tweets. In fact, the company explains how they handled promotion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding promotion, we&#8217;ve been tweeting it out and liking the facebook page we&#8217;ve set up and luckily, it&#8217;s now trending on ThemeForest. It helps that I&#8217;m on the east coast of Canada and my partner is in Sydney, Australia, so we&#8217;re able to pretty much cover comment replies quickly at any time of the day. I think that goes a long way to helping promote a positive vibe about the theme.</p></blockquote>
<p>After 24 hours, the company has six sales at $43 each. It&#8217;s not a huge amount, but it&#8217;s a start. The big takeaways is that ThemeForest reviews are catching insecure coding practices and making the first sale is a quick endeavor, especially if you already have a social media presence.

<p>We know that in this instance, ThemeForest did its job to discover insecure coding practices during reviews.¬†It&#8217;s also refreshing to hear from an up and coming theme company that they&#8217;re tired of theme options. I haven&#8217;t used their product so I can&#8217;t confirm if its claims are true, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction to see other ThemeForest sellers make such statements in public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 07:33:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

WIRED is one of the smart ones, and just launched an awesome redesign on WordPress. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/our-new-site/">From their editor-in-chief</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in 1994 we launched Hotwired, the first site with original editorial content created for the web. It was a digital home for reporting on the future of science, business, design, and technology. You‚Äôve come to trust us over the past two decades, but our growth online has sometimes come too quickly and with some pain. When I took over as editor in chief in 2012, WIRED had an archive of more than 100,000 stories. That‚Äôs good! But they were spread out over more than a dozen different databases, sections, and homepages tenuously connected by virtual duct tape and chewing gum. The cleanup process‚Äîonerous and without a shred of glamour‚Äîtook almost 15 months. But finally, last year, our engineers rolled out a newly unified site architecture built atop a single streamlined WordPress installation. And you didn‚Äôt notice a hiccup. Maybe you saw that pages loaded a touch faster. Stories looked more WIRED.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/wired-dot-com-from-the-devs/">the engineering behind it from Kathleen Vignos is also cool</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The redesign gives us the third incarnation of our Curator application, which started years ago as a separate Groovy on Grails application maintained by a single Java developer. Curator once consumed articles from 35 different blogs for curation on our homepage. When we migrated our 17 active WordPress blogs into one WordPress install, we also rewrote Curator in Cake PHP to match our WordPress PHP backend. After this, anyone on our team could maintain Curator‚Äîbut the architecture remained the same and lived outside of WordPress. Using this version of Curator, our web producer team manually constructed the homepage throughout each day as various stories were ready to be promoted.</p>
<p>Our new and improved Curator is now a custom WordPress plugin‚Äîand it‚Äôs artificially intelligent! This allows our homepage and section landing pages to be both automated and curated at the same time. Stories flow through automagically based on editorial criteria, but editors can take control of the flow by locking stories in certain slots in our card system. This means our homepage and section landing pages are constantly changing with new stories all day long.</p></blockquote>
<p>Curator sounds cool, as does the coming &#8220;longform feature article builder.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 02:36:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Ninja Forms <a title="https://ninjaforms.com/version-2-9/" href="https://ninjaforms.com/version-2-9/">2.9 is available</a> and features an improved user experience along with major performance enhancements. One of the biggest performance problems 2.9 solves is handling large forms. Prior to 2.9, users had to edit a php.ini file to handle the increased amount of server resources needed to process long forms, something many shared webhosts don&#8217;t allow. According to Kevin Stover, lead developer of Ninja Forms, 2.9 not only solves this problem, but the form builder is more efficient overall.</p>
<blockquote><p>In our local tests, a 578 field form was 12.8mb and took 33.52 seconds to load. (It also occasionally crashed our browser.) In version 2.9, the same form was only 1.2mb and took only 1.41 seconds to load. We call that progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The user experience is vastly improved compared to earlier versions of the plugin. Now when you edit an existing form or want to create a new one, you&#8217;re taken to the form builder instead of a page filled with confusing settings. After installing Ninja Forms, it took less than five minutes to recreate the <a title="http://wptavern.com/contact-me" href="http://wptavern.com/contact-me">Tavern&#8217;s contact form</a>.</p>

<p>A small but noticeable change is that, when you create a new form without a submit button and save it, a model window pops up reminding you to add one. Or, you can let Ninja Forms add it automatically. It&#8217;s hard to make a form useful without a submit button!</p>

<p>One of the major changes to the form building experience is configuring fields. In previous versions of Ninja Forms, all of the configuration options for fields were in view which felt overwhelming. In Ninja Forms 2.9, field options are hidden behind drop down menus that are closed by default. This allows you to configure them at your own pace.</p>

<p>Overall, Ninja Forms 2.9 is a solid release and offers a better experience than its predecessors. I found it easier to build forms without having to rely on documentation. Stover says this release, &#8220;lays the groundwork for even better stuff to come down the road.&#8221; You can download Ninja Forms free from the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.</p>

<p>The BuddyPress 2.3 development cycle is now in full swing, following a successful 2.2.1 maintenance release that <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-breaks-one-day-download-record-with-2-2-1-release" target="_blank">broke the plugin&#8217;s one-day download record</a> with more than 10,000 downloads in just 24 hours. More minor fixes are on deck for inclusion in the forthcoming 2.2.2 release.</p>
<p>This week contributors identified priorities for new features and improvements to work on for the <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/bp-2-3-0-dev-cycle-contributor-priorities/" target="_blank">2.3 development cycle</a>. Updates to BuddyPress&#8217; existing APIs and work on the following new APIs commenced this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6210" target="_blank">New Invitations API</a> &#8211; a flexible API to create/retrieve invitations across components</li>
<li><a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429" target="_blank">New Attachments API</a> &#8211; a new component to manage BuddyPress attachments</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/paulgibbs/buddypress/tree/posts2posts" target="_blank">Possible new Relationships API</a> &#8211; for the Favorites/Likes features</li>
<li>Improvements to Member Types API &#8211; <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5192" target="_blank">ability to create member-type-specific xprofile fields</a>, fixes for existing bugs</li>
<li>Notifications API &#8211; <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6257" target="_blank">add a metadata table</a> &#8211; useful for storing additional data outside the available notification table&#8217;s schema</li>
</ul>
<p>New APIs would make it possible for BuddyPress developers to build extensions that bring in more exciting features, such as a core-supported way to manage media/user galleries, local avatar management, invitation capabilities for groups, sites, blogs, docs, etc. The APIs give developers a way to custom tailor those experiences for their communities.</p>
<p>While none of these APIs and improvements are yet guaranteed to make it into 2.3, contributors have hammered out the tickets they will be investing in during the next three months. The official release is currently targeted for the end of May, 2015. To follow progress on tickets for the 2.3 milestone, check out the <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.3" target="_blank">roadmap</a> on BuddyPress trac.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 04 Mar 2015 22:10:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

He&#8217;s one of three co-founders of WooThemes and was instrumental in <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/about/">their growth</a> and success they achieved from 2008 until his departure in late 2013.</p>
<p>Today, Adii is¬†making the second step of his WordPress comeback. In addition to <a href="https://receiptful.com/">Receiptful</a> &#8212; his new eCommerce receipts product &#8212; he&#8217;s taking on an advisory role with Obox, to go along with a cash¬†investment in the company.</p>
<p><a href="http://oboxthemes.com/">Obox</a> is based in Cape Town, South Africa &#8212; where Adii and WooThemes are also based. Obox has been around the block as well.</p>
<p>They were founded in 2009 and are lead by brothers Marc and David Perel. Obox has experienced¬†times of great success &#8212; peaking as a team of 8 in 2012 &#8212; and also years where they&#8217;ve scaled back in response to more competition and watering down of the WordPress theme market.</p>
<p>Before Adii left WooThemes, he had numerous conversations with Obox about an acquisition, but the parties could never agree on the specifics.</p>
<h3>Adii now owns a 30% stake in Obox</h3>
<p>David Perel showed Adii some screenshots of Layers while they were wrapping up development of <a title="Layers, by Obox, introduces a beautiful page building interface" href="https://poststatus.com/layers-theme-obox/">the new product</a>. Adii was intrigued and they started once again talking about joining forces, except this time the direction changed; they started talking about what it would look like for Adii to join Obox.</p>
<p>Adii has made a cash investment in the Obox team, in return for a 30% stake in the company. The investment gives Obox a valuation in the millions of dollars, &#8220;but¬†less than $10 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cash from Adii&#8217;s investment is largely going to be used for operating expenses for the Obox team as they create the business model around Layers. Obox has also beefed up their team by <a href="http://blog.oboxthemes.com/calyx-joins-obox/">acquihiring Calyx</a>, a two man Cape Town agency.</p>
<p>According to David, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;Every cent Obox raises and makes will go into Layers.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Roller coaster ride</h3>
<p>Adii has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride since his departure of WooThemes. I&#8217;ve heard both Adii and his cofounders (Magnus Jepson and Mark Forrester) describe their split as a divorce. It was a hard time.</p>
<p>The split was complete, and Adii released all ownership of the company for an amount he has <a href="http://mixergy.com/interviews/adii-pienaar-public-beta-interview/">confirmed on Mixergy</a> was seven figures. He tells me that he has been fully paid for his shares.</p>
<p>With cash in hand, Adii had room to take¬†some risks, and with that risk came a mixture of successes and failures. His first foray into another product was Public Beta, which had many iterations before he ultimately deemed it a lost cause.</p>
<p>His latest startup seems to have¬†traction; Receiptful has had a successful launch, is getting nice adoption, and is expanding to multiple eCommerce platforms after an initial WooCommerce-only launch.</p>
<p>Time heals all wounds, and it appears Adii&#8217;s relationship with WooThemes is also mended. They even <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/2015/02/why-customized-receipts-increase-ecommerce-revenue/">blogged about Receiptful</a> recently on the main WooThemes blog.</p>
<h3>Renewed passion for WordPress</h3>
<p>Both Receiptful and the Obox investment show renewed passion for WordPress, as well as a sign of Adii getting back to his roots and what he knows best. With the launch of WooCommerce, Adii spearheaded what became a huge success during his time at WooThemes; and WooCommerce has only further grown since his departure.</p>
<p>Adii hopes to take what he&#8217;s learned &#8212; both at WooThemes and with his adventures since &#8212; to his role at Obox.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the biggest challenges within WordPress is the disconnect between how developers and end-users use it, which makes building great WordPress products really hard. It&#8217;s also something that we encountered often at Woo and instead of truly tackling the problem we leaned towards building tools for developers.</p>
<p>Layers is different in that sense, because it&#8217;s focused on the (end-)user experience from the ground up. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to work with David &amp; Marc to grow Layers, as they&#8217;re fanatical about UX and it&#8217;s my belief that they&#8217;ll finally make progress to closing the gap between a developer tool and end-user product.</p>
<p>And in terms of the commercialisation of Layers&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s just say that I see opportunities and patterns that were prevalent in WooCommerce&#8217;s early days too&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<h3>A new step for a dynamic WordPress figure</h3>
<p>Adii was a huge and dynamic figure in the early days of WordPress&#8217; commercial product space. He&#8217;s always made bold decisions &#8212; some good and some not so good.</p>
<p>He has a penchant¬†to make quick decisions and he iterates at a rapid pace; to some it can be off-putting, but for finding a hit it can be hugely important. In contrast, the Obox team makes calculated risks. While they&#8217;ve done a great deal of interesting work and experimentation on their own, they have largely stuck with the theme business while some of their early theme competitors rotated toward plugins and other verticals.</p>
<p>I believe that the combination of Adii and the Perel brothers will make for a compelling trio of leadership at the helm for Obox. Their Layers launch <a href="http://blog.oboxthemes.com/what-hitting-the-top-spot-on-product-hunt-did-to-our-launch-day/">certainly made waves</a>, and their next steps will be hugely important for the future of a company that has gone all in on a product without a monetization strategy.</p>

Following the successful <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design" target="_blank">launch of the new theme directory</a>, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">plugin directory</a> is getting the same treatment with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/" target="_blank">a fresh coat of paint</a> and a set of brand new features.</p>
<p>Browsing the official plugin directory is now similar to searching via the admin plugin browser. Having all of this code on hand made it easier for the meta team to replicate the experience in the directory.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png" rel="prettyphoto[39957]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png?resize=1025%2C970" alt="wordpress-plugin-directory" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39963" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to the new design, the directory includes a new section for logged-in users to manage favorited plugins. Previously, users had to navigate to their own profile pages to access this information. With more than 36,000 listings in the directory, favorites are becoming an important feature for users who want to keep track of plugins they use frequently.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plugin-favorites.png" rel="prettyphoto[39957]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plugin-favorites.png?resize=1025%2C511" alt="plugin-favorites" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39975" /></a></p>
<p>The &#8220;Popular&#8221; section seems to be populated by extensions with the highest number of active installs. It would be helpful to be able to further sort popular plugins based on different criteria, i.e. the most-favorited plugins and those with the highest ratings.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/beta/" target="_blank">Beta Testing</a> is a new section which you may recognize from the WordPress admin. It lists all the feature plugins that are currently under consideration for inclusion in core at some point in the future. This more prominent display will help users discover the plugins, resulting in an increase in feedback for contributors.</p>
<p>Users can also now search for plugins based on author, keyword, or tag. Searching is lightning fast, but it could be improved with filtering options to further narrow down the results.</p>
<p>Although individual plugin pages did not receive a design update, they now reflect more accurate data with the number of active installs for each plugin. This provides plugin authors with a better understanding of how many sites are actively using that functionality, as opposed to just having downloaded it once and then uninstalled it.</p>
<p>The new design is more visually-oriented than the previous one, making it easier for users to quickly scan through a long list of results. It is now more important than ever for developers to prioritize <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-adds-custom-icons-to-the-plugin-installer" target="_blank">plugin branding</a> if they want their work to stand out in the official directory.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/" target="_blank">announcement</a> about updates to the plugin directory, WordPress.org contributor Scott Reilly said that a backend reimplementation of the directory is on the roadmap for a future update.

<p>How many football fields would it take to cover that much spam? Twelve¬†and a half.</p>
<p>How about the real comments? We got a total of 131,465,000 of those this month.

<p>Last week Jason Schuller launched his Pickle WordPress theme on <a href="https://pickle.pub/" target="_blank">Pickle.pub</a> and the product is now available on <a href="https://creativemarket.com/circa75/208774-The-Pickle-Theme-for-WordPress" target="_blank">Creative Market</a>. Pickle is a restaurant theme that is packaged with a custom admin design to provide a seamless content-editing experience.</p>
<p>Schuller&#8217;s decision to <a href="http://wptavern.com/jason-schuller-to-re-enter-wordpress-theme-market-with-niche-admin-designs" target="_blank">re-enter the WordPress theme market</a> following the sale of Press75 came after several years of experimenting with alternative publishing platforms. In an <a href="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-jason-schuller-founder-of-press75-com" target="_blank">interview</a> with the Tavern last year, he expressed dissatisfaction with trying to make WordPress do what he wanted, which caused him to consider abandoning the platform entirely.</p>
<p>Schuller found himself chronically at odds with WordPress&#8217; limitations for scaling its complexity backwards to provide a more simplified publishing experience. Pickle was born out of this frustration. The theme reimagines the WordPress admin as an extension of the front-end design, with no abrupt transitions for editing content.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pickle-admin.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[39892]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pickle-admin.jpg?resize=1025%2C682" alt="pickle-admin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39907" /></a></p>
<h3>Targeting a Wider Market Beyond WordPress</h3>
<p>At first glance, it might appear that the restaurant niche is a relatively small and limited market for a WordPress theme developer. However, if you check out <a href="https://pickle.pub/" target="_blank">Pickle.pub</a>, you&#8217;ll find no mention of WordPress among Pickle&#8217;s features. Schuller is intentionally marketing it to a larger potential customer base that includes anyone looking to build a simple restaurant website.</p>
<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm not really advertising Pickle as a WordPress theme,&#8221; Schuller told the Tavern. &#8220;Essentially, my approach was to use WordPress to create my own custom CMS for minimalist restaurant websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the future he plans to release more options, styles and add-ons for the product. Currently, all of Pickle&#8217;s functionality is packed into the theme, but Schuller is not overly concerned about data portability in this instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That data (in my opinion) is exclusive to what I‚Äôm doing with Pickle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In other words, <span class="pullquote alignleft">I‚Äôm not concerned with my users even knowing that it‚Äôs powered by WordPress.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Schuller is hoping to attract two different markets: customers who know they want WordPress and those who just know they want a business website and don&#8217;t care what software it uses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shouldn‚Äôt matter to new users if it‚Äôs a WordPress solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But at the same time, freelancers who work with WordPress and have clients in the restaurant industry might be attracted by Pickle because it is a WordPress solution. I‚Äôm hoping to target both ends of the spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time around in the WordPress theme business, Schuller is venturing into the frontier where customers aren&#8217;t already convinced of a favorite CMS. Pickle was intentionally designed to make WordPress, and all its complexity, effectively invisible. This is one of the reasons the theme does not currently support the use of 3rd-party plugins.</p>
<h3>At Odds with WordPress Theme Development Best Practices</h3>
<p>WordPress core doesn&#8217;t make it easy for developers to heavily customize the admin. This will soon change when the WP REST API lands in core; Schuller is open to updating Pickle to use the API once it&#8217;s no longer under heavy development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the REST API lands in core, there would be no reason for me not to change my approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But for today, a little custom CSS and PHP will do just fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pickle is Schuller&#8217;s attempt at testing the waters for the possibility of other niche admin designs in the future. A hosted version is also set to launch within the next month. &#8220;If all goes well, I‚Äôll probably create more niche solutions from the simple HTML templates I‚Äôve been releasing on <a href="https://leeflets.com" target="_blank">Leeflets</a>,&#8221; he said. These include other one-page designs for things like newsletters, biographies, galleries, and landing or product pages.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that‚Äôs something I do end up doing, I would probably create some sort of admin theming plugin in order to eliminate duplicating the work each time,&#8221; Schuller said. &#8220;I could see the result of that being its own product as well for WordPress.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment, he is not prioritizing putting the functionality into a plugin. However, the way Pickle is built is at odds with WordPress theme development best practices of separating plugin functionality from the theme&#8217;s design.</p>
<p>If a major release of WordPress causes a break in Pickle, it&#8217;s not in a plugin where one could easily disable the functionality. A breaking change could possibly effect the site&#8217;s frontend design, without an update to Pickle. If the product were packaged as a theme plus plugin combination, users would be in a better position for updates from both core and Pickle.</p>
<p>Schuller contends that WordPress theme developers should have the option to add features in a more modular fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>I realize that my approach for Pickle specifically probably isn&#8217;t the way most ‚ÄúWordPress‚Äù developers would have done it. The important thing is that I finished it, and the idea is out there regardless of how it was engineered. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt that a good CMS should reflect the functionality you need for any given project. For instance, we shouldn&#8217;t assume that all themes should support links, comments, widgets, etc., or even posts for that matter. Some themes/users might only need &#8220;pages&#8221; which means that most of the admin menus in WordPress could and maybe should be hidden in that case. We have to manually add &#8220;theme support&#8221; within theme functions for features like &#8220;post thumbnails&#8221;, so why isn&#8217;t that the case for everything else?</p></blockquote>
<p>After years of frustration with &#8220;the WordPress way,&#8221; Schuller is going his own way this time around. He finds himself at friction with WordPress best practices and the ability to serve a larger market of people who don&#8217;t care if a site is built on WordPress.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, I really wasn‚Äôt concerned about what the WordPress developer community would think about how I engineered Pickle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know there are probably so many ways I could have done it better, or hired someone else to do it better for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In creating Pickle, Schuller consciously chose to ignore his fear of the doing_it_wrong() brigade in order to deliver a product that he believes will be simple for customers to use.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I got started with WordPress back in 2007, I had no clue what I was doing, but I was creating things and putting them out there as I learned, which is how I grew Press75. Somewhere along the way, I became much too concerned with how the WordPress community might perceive what I was making and that‚Äôs when my business started to decline. </p>
<p>Instead of just being happy making things I was passionate about, I became obsessed with perfection and making sure everyone was going be happy with what I made. I‚Äôm not going to make that same mistake again. It‚Äôs so much more important to put your work out there (even if it‚Äôs not perfect) than to never put it out there at all in fear that someone might not agree with the way you did it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could business be as simple as building products that make both you and your customer happy? Do all WordPress sites need a long-term plan for data portability and separation of theme and plugin functionality?</p>
<h3>Re-Imagining WordPress as an Invisible CMS</h3>
<p>The invisibility of the traditional admin in the Pickle theme is a tribute to WordPress&#8217; flexibility as a CMS. However, the lack of theme/plugin functionality separation is my primary objection to how it&#8217;s built, as it may make it difficult for the user to keep pace with core updates. This could potentially become a security issue.</p>
<p>Schuller&#8217;s approach for one-page designs may not conform to best practices but it once again begs the question: how can we erase the separation between editing experience and the display of content? Many users find the native customizer in its current state to be too clunky to adequately handle this in an elegant way.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t fully support the approach that Schuller took with building Pickle, I agree with the basic premise of pushing the boundaries to simplify WordPress for the user. Pickle is inspirational, despite its technical drawbacks. It is a groundbreaking example of a WordPress-powered content editing experience that is perfectly tailored to the frontend design. It&#8217;s a design-specific theme that doesn&#8217;t require a heavy page builder or multiple sub-panels of customizer options.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees on the best way to make the WordPress editing experience better while moving theme development forward. The platform needs people who are dissatisfied with the status quo to spearhead new, unorthodox ways of solving problems. However, it also needs the folks who have managed to keep inspiration alive for years, while working on the less glamorous tasks of contributing to core and establishing standards to make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>As niche admin designs become common, the answer to the question of &#8220;What does WordPress look like?&#8221; will get fuzzy and difficult to define. A more modular approach to theming WordPress as a whole will make it easier for developers to sift out the functionality that users don&#8217;t need on basic websites. Finding a happy balance here will be critical for the platform to continue its reputation as a user-friendly CMS.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 23:51:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Last month, we <a title="http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress" href="http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress">polled our readers</a> to find out how many use the sticky posts feature in WordPress. Out of 322 votes, 66% said no while 34% said yes.</p>
Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll.
<p>Use cases included, featuring content in a slider, portfolio sites, and using it on a directory site. For those who sticky one post at a time, I discovered a convenient plugin that removes the sticky flag from previous sticky posts. <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/there-can-be-only-one/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/there-can-be-only-one/">There Can Be Only One,</a> developed by Alex Jones, ensures that only one sticky post is published at a time.</p>
<p>There are no options to configure. Simply install, activate, and configure which post you want to sticky. When using this plugin, you no longer have to remove the sticky flag from the previous post which saves time and effort. There Can Only Be One is Jones&#8217; first plugin submitted to the plugin directory and he&#8217;s interested to hear any feedback or suggestions you have to improve it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 22:04:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Tickets are <a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/">still available</a> for $25 which covers both days and gets you a T-Shirt, access to events, the after party, and community day.</p>
<p>The event features two days of learning about WordPress with <a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/">four tracks of sessions</a>. Two tracks are dedicated to developers while the other two are devoted to users. In a stroke of luck, the first day of WordCamp takes place on <a title="http://www.piday.org/" href="http://www.piday.org/">Pi Day,</a> which means <a title="http://pi-pizza.com/" href="http://pi-pizza.com/">free Pi pizza</a> for attendees.</p>
<p>After learning about WordPress on Saturday, folks can immediately apply their knowledge and help others on Sunday which is <a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/2015/01/26/community-day/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/2015/01/26/community-day/">Community Day</a>. Community day is similar to a WordPress contributor day in that there will be plenty of opportunities to learn, network, and share information. The schedule for community day looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keynote </strong>by¬†a well-know member of the WP community</li>
<li><strong>Kids Camp</strong>¬†a class geared towards 8-13 year olds, however, any age is welcome to attend (space permitting). Parents must be present for children under 13 and all attendees must bring a laptop. Up to 3 children under the age of 18 can attend without charge for each paid adult (parent) ticket.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathon</strong>¬†help developers, designers, and other attendees on creating¬†or improving local organization‚Äôs¬†presence on the web (the list of specific organizations will be announced later, if you know of someone who might benefit <a title="Contact" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/contact/">drop us a line</a>)</li>
<li><strong>All-day happiness bar:</strong>¬†come and learn with the best!</li>
<li><strong>Give back to Core:</strong>¬†members of the plugin and theme review team as well as core contributors will be on hand to help you give back to the global WordPress community.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/kids-camp/" href="http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/kids-camp/">Kids Camp</a> takes place on community day from 9am to noon and will cover the basics of setting up a site and what it means to publish to the web. The class is geared towards 8-13 year olds, but any age is welcome to attend. Parents or legal guardians must be present for children under 12 and all attendees must bring a laptop. Also on Sunday, <a title="http://halfelf.org/" href="http://halfelf.org/">Mika Epstein</a> will give a keynote presentation that explains how to fit into the WordPress community by being true to yourself.</p>

<p>Designers and front-end developers who work with open source software have an exciting new event to look forward to in the UK this summer. <a href="http://themeconf.com/" target="_blank">ThemeConf</a> was announced today &#8211; a brand new conference created to help themers, designers, and front-end developers recharge their batteries with a variety of unique sessions on the world of themes.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted in Keswick, England, June 18-19th at the Alhambra Cinema, one of Britain&#8217;s oldest cinemas. <a href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a> is ThemeConf&#8217;s first sponsor and three of the company&#8217;s employees are organizers for the event, including <a href="https://twitter.com/karmatosed" target="_blank">Tammie Lister</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jacklenox" target="_blank">Jack Lenox</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/schwuk" target="_blank">David Murphy</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack always had the idea for a conference like this; he also wanted something in his local area,&#8221; Lister said. &#8220;I also wanted a conference that is theme focused. We all started talking over a Christmas meetup and this is what happened from that.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Exploring the Future of Theming Beyond Specific Platforms</h3>
<p>The conference will focus on theming for open source applications such as WordPress, Drupal, Ghost, and Joomla. Themers of all experience levels are welcome, as are front-end developers who are interested in theming. The topics for the first year will be focused around the future of theming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to bring a wide range of talks under that banner,&#8221; Lister said. &#8220;We are currently curating our schedule, but it‚Äôs shaping up to be really interesting and diverse. We are planning on making it a place themers can go to get inspired.&#8221;</p>
<p>In selecting the sessions, organizers hope to further delve into the technologies and styles, beyond specific platforms, to explore the future of theming. They also plan to incorporate talks on performance and user experience.</p>
<p>Jack Lenox wants to focus the event around some of the most recent and significant shifts in theming and front-end development. &#8220;These go beyond the platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;From REST APIs, to new design directions and into the burgeoning ecosystem of the new JavaScript tools such as React &#8211; tools that allow us to build engaging, human user experiences alongside a REST API.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one platform cannot possibly hold a monopoly on technical innovation, it&#8217;s important for designers and developers to venture outside the bubble of their primary platform in order to stay on the cutting edge. ThemeConf organizers are aiming to facilitate cross-platform collaboration and knowledge sharing to help attendees explore a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>The event will be non-profit, with any proceeds going into the next year and/or donated to the local area. The 101-year-old Alhambra Cinema is an intimate venue that will be limited to 150 attendees.
